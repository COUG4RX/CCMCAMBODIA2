                    <span class="fs-5 fw-bold">1. Purpose</span><br><br>
                    <span class="text-secondary fw-light">Oversight is one of the key functions of the Country Coordinating Mechanisms. According to Requirement 3 of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) guidelines for CCMs, each CCM must have an oversight plan and follow this plan. To implement its oversight plan, the CCC needs to have an oversight body in place. CCC established the Oversight Committee as a permanent CCC committee to perform this task.</span><br><br>

                    <span class="text-secondary fw-light">The Oversight Committee is responsible for contributing to effective oversight of all Global Fund financed programs and related processes in Cambodia, in accordance with the functions delegated to it by the Cambodia Country Coordinating Committee for the Global Fund (“the CCC”) as defined in the CCC Governance Manual and these Terms of Reference. The Committee assists the CCC to fulfill its responsibility to hold Principal Recipients accountable for resources given to the country: “CCMs are required to put in place and maintain a transparent, documented process to … oversee program implementation”.[1]</span><br><br><br>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <span class="fs-5 fw-bold">2. Membership</span><br><br>
                    <span class="text-secondary fw-light">The Oversight Committee shall consist of two Co-Chairs and up to fifteen Ordinary Members, endorsed by the CCC and divided in three disease subgroups. Membership of the CCC is not a prerequisite for membership of the Oversight Committee but at least one of the Co-Chairs must be the CCC member. Members of the oversight committee shall not be representatives of Principal Recipients. Sub-recipients or sub-sub-recipients maybe invited to select OC meetings to provide input on technical matters, however to mitigate COI they should not be involved in any discussion or decision directly related to their institution/organization/agency.</span><br><br><br>

                    <span class="text-secondary fw-light">The CCC shall invite and endorse members of the Oversight Committee, based on propositions made by the Oversight Committee. Candidates who are non-CCC members will be required to complete the same conflict of interest declarations prepared by all CCC members. The CCC will determine whether, based on the non-CCC candidate's declaration, he/she meets the standard for conflict of interest required for members of the Oversight Committee. Oversight Committee members are appointed under the same terms and conditions as regular CCC members.</span><br><br><br>

                    <span class="text-secondary fw-light">The Global Fund minimum standards require that “the OC should have access to skills in the following: disease-specific skills, program management, financial management and procurement and supply management. In addition, ideally there should be representation of KAP and PLWD”. Thus the CCC Oversight Committee will ensure that a broad set of skills are represented among members. A such, the following expertise is encouraged</span><br><br><br>

                    <span class="text-secondary fw-light">Implementation of public and private sector interventions in HIV-AIDS, TB, malaria or health systems strengthening (HSS) programs at the national and/or provincial levels.
                    Finance or accounting in medium / large public or private sector organizations.
                    Experience working with advocacy organizations representing people living with or affected by the diseases.
                    Members should have substantial experience (e.g., 8-10 years) in the relevant areas of expertise.</span><br><br><br>

                    <span class="text-secondary fw-light">The Oversight Committee shall meet at least quarterly, and may meet more frequently as circumstances require (such as PR reporting cycles). Meetings shall take place about 2 weeks prior to each regular quarterly CCC meeting, so that Committee deliberations may be reported to the CCC. When possible, the Oversight Committee should receive the appropriate supporting documents from the CCC in time for each regular meeting, in order to fulfill its oversight responsibilities.</span><br><br><br>

                    <span class="text-secondary fw-light">The Oversight Committee will then report to the next CCC meeting on its deliberations and recommendations.</span><br><br><br>

                    <span class="text-secondary fw-light">The Oversight Committee may invite representatives of the <span class="text-decoration-underline">PRs and SRs, LFA and other implementing partners and stakeholders</span>  to attend its meetings and field visits (as needed) in view of providing information, feedback, and expertise to enrich the deliberations.</span><br><br>

                    <span class="text-secondary fw-light">It is recommended that each disease subgroup be represented at each regular Oversight Committee meeting. The attendance of at least one of the co-chairs is required for each meeting.</span><br><br><br>

                    <span class="text-secondary">The potential for conflicts of interest in oversight committee members can be considerable because the CCC OC members may include Global Fund grant implementers. CCC conflict-of-interest mitigation policy provides clear procedures on identification, declaration, documentation, and management of conflicts of interest.</span><br><br><br>
                    <span class="text-secondary">All Oversight Committee members must declare any conflict of interest that will or could arise in the course of undertaking their oversight duties. All will sign a declaration at the beginning of their service. In addition, whenever the situation arises, a member must immediately declare his or her conflict of interest. The member must recuse himself or herself from conflicted matters under discussion.</span><br><br><br>
